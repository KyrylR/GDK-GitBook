# ðŸ›  Setup

## DAO Tools

{% embed url="https://q-dao.tools/" %}
&#x20;Your entry point to all DAO tools you need to start.
{% endembed %}

In the system two entry points: DAO Factory and Dashboard, which you can access from the Q DAO Tools page.

### DAO Factory

{% embed url="https://factory.q-dao.tools/" %}
Tool to create a decentralized organization in a few clicks
{% endembed %}

You can configure and deploy your own DAO with DAO Factory. The process is simple and self-explanatory. If there are questions during this process, there is a page with a detailed explanation of each step:

{% content-ref url="steps-to-deploy-a-dao-on-q.md" %}
[steps-to-deploy-a-dao-on-q.md](steps-to-deploy-a-dao-on-q.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### DAO Dashboard

{% embed url="https://hq.q-dao.tools/" %}
Your tool to participate in the Governance process
{% endembed %}

If you have already created a DAO, use the DAO HQ to set your voting weight and create or manage proposals.

This is a stunning platform where you can build your organization or create a group that will help you achieve solid structure and integrity in your web3 endeavours.&#x20;

Or, if you already have experience in web3, you will learn and gain knowledge on "Beyond Code is Law".

## Governance

So, when you have deployed your DAO or joined another DAO, you may face three problems on both sides:&#x20;

* How to distribute tokens/Where to get DAO tokens?&#x20;
* How to attract new users/How to get involved?&#x20;
* Where do you go from here? What is the DAO for?&#x20;

In order to be able to vote, a user needs to deposit a certain number of tokens into the DAO repository, so we face a combination of the first two problems - finding DAO tokens, getting them from the user perspective, and attracting users and distributing them from the DAO creator perspective.&#x20;

These problems can be solved by actively communicating on Discord, Telegram, or other social networks where Q is available.&#x20;

So spread the word about your DAO in community channels or try to find a few other DAOs and get tokens there; it's up to you!&#x20;

In the next step, you can go deeper into DAO, create your modules, integrate them into your own DAO, and customize and install it as you see fit.&#x20;

Here are a few and the most important things you need to know about management&#x20;

* You need to contribute a certain number of DAO tokens to be able to vote, even if you are an expert.&#x20;
* To become an expert, you can create a membership vote to be added to a certain expert group.&#x20;
* To be able to veto, you need to be a member of a Guardian expert group, and it can be one of the existing groups or an ad hoc group.
