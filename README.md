# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Governance SDK

## Overview

You can use Q GDK to set up your DAO in a simple and quick fashion. As this SDK was already battle-tested for the governance of the Q blockchain, you can set up your organization around a community, set dedicated roles and responsibilities and define the rules that govern your DAO.

It is a place where you can play around, experiment with DAO, get basic knowledge and evolve your understanding of decentralization.

## Why GDK?

The GDK will allow you to organize any **Governance** over the DAO as you want, distribute responsibilities among **Expert Panels** (there can be zero or as many as you wish), have voting in which ERC20, ERC721 or ERC5484 (SBT) tokens are considered voting rights, and much more.

With this system, you will have options such as:

* Set up governance with a Permission Manager.
* Deploy your own ERC20, ERC721, ERC5484 tokens.
* Deploy Expert Panels responsible for specific areas (DeFi, Bridge, Incentives, etc.).
* Integrate your contracts in the DAO.
* Manage your contracts through the DAO Registry and much more.

## Try it yourself!

The [DAO Info page](https://q-dao.tools/) is your entry point to all DAO tools you need to start.

[DAO Factory](https://factory.q-dao.tools/) - a tool to create a decentralized organization in just a few clicks. You can set multiple roles and implement strong checks and balances on proposals.

[DAO Dashboard](https://hq.q-dao.tools/) - if you have already created a DAO, use the DAO HQ to set your voting weight and create or manage proposals.

[Core GDK contracts](https://gitlab.com/q-dev/q-gdk/gdk-contracts) - the heart of the system, contains contracts for initial DAO deployment as well as core DAO contracts such as DAO Registry, DAO Vault, Permission Manager, Votings, QRC20 and QRC721 tokens, etc.  Also available on [the NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@q-dev/gdk-contracts).&#x20;

[GDK SDK](https://gitlab.com/q-dev/q-gdk/gdk-sdk) - typescript library for interacting with GDK Contracts. It greatly extends the functionality of the [DAO Dashboard](https://hq.q-dao.tools/). With it, you can deploy, configure and interact with your DAO at an advanced level.
